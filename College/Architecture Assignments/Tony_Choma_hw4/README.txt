In this particular assignment I believe it is at a 50% due to the fact 
that I never got the DIV working and the mcc compiler kept telling me that it was expecting 
an ";" despite checking for hours where it could throw an error. Thus I gave up due to the 
amount of time I have left. Conceptually I understood what had to be done but I couldn't 
continue further due to either the broken mcc file from Bill that is required or I serverely 
missed something in the provided microcode.
