How to run the program
///////////////////////////////////////
1. First download required files and copy them into the same directory the asm file is located
Availability of prom file and assembler for RSHIFT, MUL, DIV 

You can find these objects on the CS server (cs.uml.edu) at:

~bill/cs305/a6_help_dir/masm_mrd       (the assembler executable)
~bill/cs305/a6_help_dir/prom_mrd.dat   (the microcode needed for RSHIFT, MUL, DIV)

2. In the folder directory run this command in terminal
    ./masm_mrd < adder.asm >adder.obj
    you can use a different name for the obj file 
    but make sure the asm file is exactly the same as the one 
    in the directory
3. While still in the same directory run
    ./mic1 prom_mrd.dat adder.obj 0 2048
    and this will start the program
4. Input a positive number, hit enter, then enter another and hit enter
5. You now have a sum of the two numbers you inputted!
