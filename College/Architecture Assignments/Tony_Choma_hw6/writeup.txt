This assignment borrows from assignment 5 where we had to split the asm file into 
seperate functions and put the functions into new .asm files. The linker links all
of the files together resulting in the same program in assignment 5. In terms of 
completion, my version works 100% to specification. The only problem I had was the
masm_mrd didn't have executable permissions on the server so I lost a few minutes there.
